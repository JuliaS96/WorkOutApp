# Workout: Home & Gym Workouts

## Project Description


- **What will the application do?**

The application is a workout app. The app will have a list of workouts 
that the user can use, or
the user can select different exercises and build their own workouts.
When the user selects a workout, the app will sequentially provide each 
exercise in a timed manner.


- **Who will use it?**

The application may be used by *individuals who are interested in 
working* out to select a predetermined training regimen for the day, 
or by *more experienced individuals / gym trainers* who will construct a proper workout regimen. 

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is something that I've had in mind for a while, as I was unhappy
with the functionality of the workout app I was using. The idea came to me 
while being frustrated that the app I was using
did not allow me to alter the workouts or create my own.
